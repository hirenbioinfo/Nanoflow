# Nanopipe 
##  Pipeline Summary

## Steps
### 1. Basecalling and demiltiplexing
### 2. Sequencing QC
### 3. Assembly
### 4. Assembly Polishing
### 5. Circularization
Nextflow pipeline for Oxford Nanopore data analysis 


Please note that this pipeline does not perform extensive quality assessment of the input sequencing data. Contamination and sequencing read quality should be assessed independently to avoid problems with assembly.
